## Extra-ish Credit
### Password Checker
Ask the user to enter a password. Ask them to confirm the password. If it's not equal, keep asking until it's correct or they enter q to quit.

Ex1
x= -20
while(x<50):
    x=x+10
    print(x)
Ex2
x= 0
while(x<20):
    x=x+2
    print(x)
Ex3
x= [int(2), int(2), int(2), int(2)]
x= x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3]
print(x)
Ex4
numbers= 0
while(numbers<100):
    numbers= numbers + 25
    print(numbers)
